# JAMS Ingestion Server

This is a small Node.js server that exposes a C (as in CRUD) RESTful API for generic JAMS data, backed by MongoDB. It could (and should) be extended to provide read and update features specific to the JAMS format so that it can be deployed as a generic server for a wide variety of musicological data storage, however at the moment it's streamlined for my specific research into velocity aware trajectorial playlisting.
